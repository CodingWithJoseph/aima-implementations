# Math Review for Chapter 4

## Must Know

**Calculus**
- Derivatives, partial derivatives (∂f/∂x)
- Gradient vector: ∇f = (∂f/∂x₁, ∂f/∂x₂, ...)
- Finding maxima/minima (set derivative to 0)

**Linear Algebra**
- Vector operations
- Matrix multiplication and inverse
- Hessian matrix (matrix of second derivatives)

**Probability**
- Basic distributions
- Boltzmann distribution: e^(ΔE/T) (for simulated annealing)

## Optional

- Convex functions/sets (section 4.2)
- Set operations (union, intersection) for belief states

## By Section

- **4.1 Local Search** - Basic calculus
- **4.2 Continuous** - Heavier calculus/linear algebra (can skip initially)
- **4.3-4.5** - Mostly algorithmic (set operations)

Focus on gradients and partial derivatives. You can implement most algorithms without deep math knowledge.
